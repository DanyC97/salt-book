The Salt Master
===============

In this chapter we'll be setting up our ``Salt master`` and hooking up our
existing ``minion`` to the ``master``. This means we can start running
commands, and treating that server as though it's part of an actual 
infrastructure. Our ``master`` server will be very similar spec wise to the
``minion`` that was previously created, as we won't need a lot of resources
for what we'll be doing. When you finish this chapter you'll have a ``master``
server, and a single ``minion`` that you can control from the master.
