The Masterless Minion
=====================

The simplest configuration to get started with is the ``masterless minion``.
This is simply a minion server, where you call all of your commands, as well
as configuration files locally. This server does not use key authentication,
since it's just the ``minion`` itself. What makes this a great starting place
for this book is that the ``masterless minion`` takes about 5 minutes to set
up. In this chapter we'll talk about how to set up our ``minion``, run some
commands, and write a few simple configuration files. By the time you're done
with this chapter you'll have a simple web server set up that actually shows
a static web page.
